### Continuous COG

This is a Center-of-Gravity model similar to 
[here](https://github.com/ticdat/ticdat/tree/master/examples/expert_section/cog), with
the difference being that the centroid locations are continuous, as opposed to being 
selected from a candidate list. The `continuous_cog.py` file was generated by ChatGPT
using the prompts 
[here](https://chatgpt.com/share/67a256fd-73ac-8005-a5b5-b5de955d5f37). Unfortunately, 
even the high end ChatGPT made some mistakes here, and the final version wasn't performant 
on the 20 data set example. So this isn't a very good example of ChatGPT helping out, IMHO.
