Go here for documentation. ticdat is a Python package that provides lightweight, ORM style functionality around either a dict-of-dicts or pandas.DataFrame representation of tables. It is well suited for defining and validating the input data for complex solve engines (i.e. optimization and scheduling-type problems). ticdat functionality is organized around two classes - TicDatFactory and PanDatFactory . Both classes define a simple database style schema on construction. Data integrity rules can then be added in the form of foreign key relationships, data field types (to include numerical ranges and allowed strings) and row predicates (functions that check if a given row violates a particular data condition). The factory classes can then be used to construct TicDat / PanDat objects that contain tables consistent with the defined schema. By design, ticdat , allows these data objects to violate the data integrity rules while providing convenient bulk query functions to determine where those violations occur. TicDat objects (created by a TicDatFactory ) contain tables in a dict-of-dict format. The outer dictionary maps primary key values to data rows. The inner dictionaries are data rows indexed by field names (similar to csv.DictReader/csv.DictWriter ). Tables that do not have primary keys are rendered as a list of data row dictionaries. PanDat objects (created by PanDatFactory ) render tables as pandas.DataFrame objects. The columns in each DataFrame will contain all of the primary key and data fields that were defined in the PanDatFactory schema. The PanDatFactory code can be thought of as implementing a shim library that organizes DataFrame objects into a predefined schema, and facilitates rich integrity checks based on schema defined rules. The ticdat example library is focused on two patterns for building optimization engines - using TicDatFactory in conjunction with gurobipy and using PanDatFactory in conjunction with amplpy . That said, ticdat can also be used with libraries like pyomo , pulp , docplex and xpress . It also has functionality to support the OPL and LINGO modeling languages, although the AMPL support is far more mature. ticdat is also useful for machine-learning applications. In this case, one typically uses PanDatFactory to provide ORM-like functionality on top of pandas , as well as to simplify the munging of time stamp data and text columns that contain exclusively numbers.

This class is constructed with a schema. It can be used to generate PanDat objects, to write PanDat objects to different file types, or to perform bulk query operations to diagnose common data integrity failures. Analytical code that uses PanDat objects can be used, without change, on different data sources, thus facilitating the \"separate model from data\" design goal. A PanDat object is itself a collection of DataFrames that conform to a predefined schema. :param init_fields: a mapping of tables to primary key fields and data fields. Each field listing consists of two sub lists ... first primary keys fields, then data fields. ex: PanDatFactory (categories = [[\"name\"],[\"Min Nutrition\", \"Max Nutrition\"]], foods = [[\"Name\"],[\"Cost\"]] nutritionQuantities = [[\"Food\", \"Category\"],[\"Qty\"]]) Use '*' instead of a pair of lists for generic tables ex: PanDatFactory (typical_table = [[\"Primary Key Field\"],[\"Data Field\"]], generic_table = '*') add_data_row_predicate PanDatFactory.add_data_row_predicate(self, table, predicate, predicate_name=None) Adds a data row predicate for a table. Row predicates can be used to check for sophisticated data integrity problems of the sort that can't be easily handled with a data type rule. For example, a min_supply column can be verified to be no larger than a max_supply column. !!! NB!!!! pandas will render None as nan. Don't check for None in your predicate functions, use pandas.isnull instead !!!!!!!!!! :param table: table in the schema :param predicate: A one argument function that accepts a table row as an argument and returns Truthy if the row is valid and Falsey otherwise.

The table with fields that must match some other table. :param foreign_table: (aka parent table). The table providing the matching entries. :param mappings: For simple foreign keys, a [native_field, foreign_field] pair. For compound foreign keys an iterable of [native_field, foreign_field] pairs. :return: clear_data_type PanDatFactory.clear_data_type(self, table, field) clears the data type for a field. By default, fields don't have types. Adding a data type doesn't block data of the wrong type from being entered. Data types are useful for recognizing errant data entries.

If the latter, then AMPL variables that pass the filter (see below) will simply populate the primary key of the table_name. Note that by default, only non-zero data is copied over.

Otherwise will return the boolean Series that indicates which rows have data type failures. :return: A dictionary constructed as follow: The keys are namedtuples with members \"table\", \"field\".

The values are DataFrames that contain the subset of rows that exhibit data failures for this specific table, field pair (or the boolean Series that identifies these rows). Note that for primary key fields (but not data fields) with no explicit data type, a temporary filter that excludes only Null will be applied. If you want primary key fields to allow Null, you must explicitly opt-in by calling set_data_type appropriately. See issue https://github.com/ticdat/ticdat/issues/46 for more info. find_duplicates PanDatFactory.find_duplicates(self, pan_dat, keep='first', as_table=True) Find the duplicated rows based on the primary key fields. :param pan_dat: pandat object :param keep: 'first': Treat all duplicated rows as duplicates except for the first occurrence. 'last': Treat all duplicated rows as duplicates except for the last occurrence. False: Treat all duplicated rows as duplicates :param as_table: as_table boolean : if truthy then the values of the return dictionary will be the duplicated rows themselves. Otherwise will return the boolean Series that indicates which rows are duplicated rows. :return: A dictionary whose keys are the table names and whose values are duplicated rows (or the Series that identifies these rows) find_foreign_key_failures PanDatFactory.find_foreign_key_failures(self, pan_dat, verbosity='High', as_table=True) Finds the foreign key failures for a pandat object :param pan_dat: pandat object :param verbosity: either \"High\" or \"Low\" :param as_table: as_table boolean : if truthy then the values of the return dictionary will be the failed rows themselves. Otherwise will return the a boolean list that indicates which rows have failures. (For technical reasons, not returning a boolean Series like the other find functions) :return: A dictionary constructed as follows: The keys are namedtuples with members \"native_table\", \"foreign_table\", \"mapping\", \"cardinality\". The key data matches the arguments to add_foreign_key that constructed the foreign key (with \"cardinality\" being deduced from the overall schema). The values are DataFrames that contain the subset of native table rows that fail to find the foreign table matching defined by the associated returned key (or the list that identifies these rows). For verbosity = 'Low' a simpler return object is created that doesn't use namedtuples and omits the foreign key cardinality. good_pan_dat_object PanDatFactory.good_pan_dat_object(self, data_obj, bad_message_handler=<function PanDatFactory.<lambda> at 0x119cda048>) determines if an object is a valid PanDat object for this schema :param data_obj: the object to verify :param bad_message_handler: a call back function to receive description of any failure message :return: True if the dataObj can be recognized as a PanDat data object. False otherwise. remove_foreign_key_failures PanDatFactory.remove_foreign_key_failures(self, pan_dat) Removes foreign key failures (i.e. child records with no parent table record) :param pan_dat: pandat object (will be side-effected) :return: pan_dat, with the foreign key failures removed Note that all foreign key removals are cascading. When a child removal results in new foreign key failures, those failures are removed as well. schema PanDatFactory.schema(self, include_ancillary_info=False) Return a dictionary that summarizes the schema. :param include_ancillary_info: if True, include all the foreign key, default, and data type information as well. Otherwise, just return table-fields dictionary :return: a dictionary with table name mapping to a list of lists defining primary key fields and data fields If include_ancillary_info, this table-fields dictionary is just one entry in a more comprehensive dictionary. set_ampl_data PanDatFactory.set_ampl_data(self, ampl_dat, ampl, table_to_set_name=None) performs bulk setData on the AMPL-esque first argument. :param ampl_dat: an AmplTicDat object created by calling copy_to_ampl :param ampl: an amplpy.AMPL object :param table_to_set_name: a mapping of table_name to ampl set name :return: set_data_type PanDatFactory.set_data_type(self, table, field, number_allowed=True, inclusive_min=True, inclusive_max=False, min=0, max=inf, must_be_int=False, strings_allowed=(), nullable=False, datetime=False) sets the data type for a field. By default, fields don't have types. Adding a data type doesn't block data of the wrong type from being entered. Data types are useful for recognizing errant data entries with find_data_type_failures(). Errant data entries can be replaced with replace_data_type_failures(). :param table: a table in the schema :param field: a data field for this table :param number_allowed: boolean does this field allow numbers? :param inclusive_min: boolean : if number allowed, is the min inclusive? :param inclusive_max: boolean : if number allowed, is the max inclusive? :param min: if number allowed, the minimum value :param max: if number allowed, the maximum value :param must_be_int: boolean : if number allowed, must the number be integral? :param strings_allowed: if a collection - then a list of the strings allowed. The empty collection prohibits strings. If a \"*\", then any string is accepted. :param nullable : boolean : can this value contain null (aka None aka nan (since pandas treats null as nan)) :param datetime: If truthy, then number_allowed through strings_allowed are ignored. Should the data either be a datetime.datetime object or a string that can be parsed into a datetime.datetime object? Note that the various readers will try to coerce strings into datetime.datetime objects on read for fields with datetime data types. pandas.Timestamp is itself a datetime.datetime, and the bias will be to create such an object. :return: set_default_value PanDatFactory.set_default_value(self, table, field, default_value) sets the default value for a specific field :param table: a table in the schema :param field: a field in the table :param default_value: the default value to apply :return: set_default_values PanDatFactory.set_default_values(self, **table_defaults) sets the default values for the fields :param table_defaults: A dictionary of named arguments.

For example df = pd.DataFrame({\"a\":[\"100\", \"200\", \"300\"]}) df.to_csv(\"something.csv\") df2 = pd.read_csv(\"something.csv\") results in a numeric column in df2. To address this, you need to either use set_data_type for your PanDatFactory, or specify \"dtype\" in kwargs. (The former is obviously better). This problem is even worse with df = pd.DataFrame({\"a\":[\"0100\", \"1200\", \"2300\"]}) write_directory CsvPanFactory.write_directory(self, pan_dat, dir_path, case_space_table_names=False, index=False, **kwargs) write the PanDat data to a collection of csv files :param pan_dat: the PanDat object to write :param dir_path: the directory in which to write the csv files Set to falsey if using con argument. :param case_space_table_names: boolean - make best guesses how to add spaces and upper case characters to table names :param index: boolean - whether or not to write the index. :param kwargs: additional named arguments to pass to pandas.to_csv :return: caveats: The row names (index) isn't written (unless kwargs indicates it should be).

A XlsPanFactory will automatically be associated with the xls attribute of the parent PanDatFactory. create_pan_dat XlsPanFactory.create_pan_dat(self, xls_file_path, fill_missing_fields=False) Create a PanDat object from an Excel file :param xls_file_path: An Excel file containing sheets whose names match the table names in the schema. :param fill_missing_fields: boolean. If truthy, missing fields will be filled in with their default value. Otherwise, missing fields throw an Exception. :return: a PanDat object populated by the matching sheets. caveats: Missing sheets resolve to an empty table, but missing fields on matching sheets throw an Exception (unless fill_missing_fields is truthy). Table names are matched to sheets with with case-space insensitivity, but spaces and case are respected for field names. (ticdat supports whitespace in field names but not table names).

This class is constructed with a schema. It can be used to generate TicDat objects, to write TicDat objects to different file types, or to perform bulk query operations to diagnose common data integrity failures. Analytical code that uses TicDat objects can be used, without change, on different data sources, thus facilitating the \"separate model from data\" design goal. :param init_fields: a mapping of tables to primary key fields and data fields. Each field listing consists of two sub lists ... first primary keys fields, than data fields. ex: TicDatFactory (categories = [[\"name\"],[\"minNutrition\", \"maxNutrition\"]], foods = [[\"name\"],[\"cost\"]] nutritionQuantities = [[\"food\", \"category\"],[\"qty\"]]) Use '*' instead of a pair of lists for generic tables, which will render as pandas.DataFrame objects. ex: TicDatFactory (typical_table = [[\"primary key field\"],[\"data field\"]], generic_table = '*') add_data_row_predicate TicDatFactory.add_data_row_predicate(self, table, predicate, predicate_name=None) Adds a data row predicate for a table. Row predicates can be used to check for sophisticated data integrity problems of the sort that can't be easily handled with a data type rule. For example, a min_supply column can be verified to be no larger than a max_supply column. :param table: table in the schema :param predicate: A one argument function that accepts a table row as an argument and returns Truthy if the row is valid and Falsey otherwise. The argument passed to predicate will be a dict that maps field name to data value for all fields (both primary key and data field) in the table. Note - if None is passed as a predicate, then any previously added predicate matching (table, predicate_name) will be removed. :param predicate_name: The name of the predicate. If omitted, the smallest non-colliding number will be used. :return: add_foreign_key TicDatFactory.add_foreign_key(self, native_table, foreign_table, mappings) Adds a foreign key relationship to the schema. Adding a foreign key doesn't block the entry of child records that fail to find a parent match. It does make it easy to recognize such records (with find_foreign_key_failures()) and to remove such records (with remove_foreign_key_failures()) :param native_table: (aka child table). The table with fields that must match some other table. :param foreign_table: (aka parent table). The table providing the matching entries. :param mappings: For simple foreign keys, a [native_field, foreign_field] pair. For compound foreign keys an iterable of [native_field, foreign_field] pairs. :return: clear_data_type TicDatFactory.clear_data_type(self, table, field) clears the data type for a field. By default, fields don't have types. Adding a data type doesn't block data of the wrong type from being entered. Data types are useful for recognizing errant data entries. If no data type is specified (the default) then no errant data will be recognized. :param table: table in the schema :param field: :return: clear_foreign_keys TicDatFactory.clear_foreign_keys(self, native_table=None) create a TicDatFactory :param native_table: optional. The table whose foreign keys should be cleared. If omitted, all foreign keys are cleared. clone TicDatFactory.clone(self) clones the TicDatFactory :return: a clone of the TicDatFactory copy_from_ampl_variables TicDatFactory.copy_from_ampl_variables(self, ampl_variables) copies the solution results from ampl_variables into a new ticdat object :param ampl_variables: a dict mapping from (table_name, field_name) -> amplpy.variable.Variable (amplpy.variable.Variable is the type object returned by AMPL.getVariable) table_name should refer to a table in the schema that has primary key fields. field_name can refer to a data field for table_name, or it can be falsey. If the latter, then AMPL variables that pass the filter (see below) will simply populate the primary key of the table_name. Note that by default, only non-zero data is copied over. If you want to override this filter, then instead of mapping to amplpy.variable.Variable you should map to a (amplpy.variable.Variable, filter) where filter accepts a data value and returns a boolean. :return: a deep copy of the ampl_variables into a ticdat object copy_tic_dat TicDatFactory.copy_tic_dat(self, tic_dat, freeze_it=False) copies the tic_dat object into a new tic_dat object performs a deep copy :param tic_dat: a ticdat object :param freeze_it: boolean. should the returned object be frozen? :return: a deep copy of the tic_dat argument copy_to_ampl TicDatFactory.copy_to_ampl(self, tic_dat, field_renamings=None, excluded_tables=None) copies the tic_dat object into a new tic_dat object populated with amplpy.DataFrame objects performs a deep copy :param tic_dat: a ticdat object :param field_renamings: dict or None. If fields are to be renamed in the copy, then a mapping from (table_name, field_name) -> new_field_name If a data field is to be omitted, then new_field can be falsey table_name cannot refer to an excluded table.

Tables without primary key fields are always excluded. :return: a deep copy of the tic_dat argument into amplpy.DataFrames copy_to_pandas TicDatFactory.copy_to_pandas(self, tic_dat, table_restrictions=None, drop_pk_columns=None) copies the tic_dat object into a new object populated with pandas.DataFrame objects performs a deep copy :param tic_dat: a ticdat object :param table_restrictions: If truthy, a list of tables to turn into data frames. Defaults to all tables. :param drop_pk_columns: boolean or None. should the primary key columns be dropped from the data frames after they have been incorporated into the index. If None, then pk fields will be dropped only for tables with data fields :return: a deep copy of the tic_dat argument into DataFrames If table_restrictions is falsey and drop_pk_columns is False, then the return object will be a valid pan_dat object. I.e. assert PanDatFactory(**self.schema()).good_pan_dat_object(rtn) works. Note that None will be converted to nan in the returned object (as is the norm for pandas.DataFrame) create_from_full_schema TicDatFactory.create_from_full_schema(full_schema) create a TicDatFactory complete with default values, data types, and foreign keys :param full_schema: a dictionary consistent with the data returned by a call to schema() with include_ancillary_info = True :return: a TicDatFactory reflecting the tables, fields, default values, data types, and foreign keys consistent with the full_schema argument enable_foreign_key_links TicDatFactory.enable_foreign_key_links(self) call to enable foreign key links. For ex. a TicDat object made from a factory with foreign key enabled will pass the following assert assert (dat.foods[\"chicken\"].nutritionQuantities[\"protein\"] is dat.categories[\"protein\"].nutritionQuantities[\"chicken\"] is dat.nutritionQuantities[\"chicken\", \"protein\"]) Note that by default, TicDatFactories don't create foreign key links since doing so can slow down TicDat creation. :return: find_data_row_failures TicDatFactory.find_data_row_failures(self, tic_dat) Finds the data row failures for a ticdat object :param tic_dat: ticdat object :return: A dictionary constructed as follow: The keys are namedtuples with members \"table\", \"predicate_name\". The values of the returned dictionary are tuples indicating which rows failed the predicate test. For tables with a primary key this tuple will contain the primary key value of each failed row. Otherwise, this tuple will list the positions of the failed rows. find_data_type_failures TicDatFactory.find_data_type_failures(self, tic_dat) Finds the data type failures for a ticdat object :param tic_dat: ticdat object :return: A dictionary constructed as follow: The keys are namedtuples with members \"table\", \"field\". Each (table,field) pair has data values that are inconsistent with its data type. (table, field) pairs with no data type at all are never part of the returned dictionary. The values of the returned dictionary are namedtuples with the following attributes. --> bad_values - the distinct values for the (table, field) pair that are inconsistent with the data type for (table, field). --> pks - the distinct primary key entries of the table containing the bad_values data. (will be row index for tables with no primary key) That is to say, bad_values tells you which values in field are failing the data type check, and pks tells you which table rows will have their field entry changed if you call replace_data_type_failures(). Note that for primary key fields (but not data fields) with no explicit data type, a temporary filter that excludes only Null will be applied. If you want primary key fields to allow Null, you must explicitly opt-in by calling set_data_type appropriately. See issue https://github.com/ticdat/ticdat/issues/46 for more info. find_foreign_key_failures TicDatFactory.find_foreign_key_failures(self, tic_dat, verbosity='High') Finds the foreign key failures for a ticdat object :param tic_dat: ticdat object :param verbosity: either \"High\" or \"Low\" :return: A dictionary constructed as follow (for verbosity = 'High'): The keys are namedtuples with members \"native_table\", \"foreign_table\", \"mapping\", \"cardinality\". The key data matches the arguments to add_foreign_key that constructed the foreign key (with \"cardinality\" being deduced from the overall schema). The values are namedtuples with the following members. --> native_values - the values of the native fields that failed to match --> native_pks - the primary key entries of the native table rows corresponding to the native_values. That is to say, native_values tells you which values in the native table can't find a foreign key match, and thus generate a foreign key failure. native_pks tells you which native table rows will be removed if you call remove_foreign_key_failures(). For verbosity = 'Low' a simpler return object is created that doesn't use namedtuples and omits the foreign key cardinality. freeze_me TicDatFactory.freeze_me(self, tic_dat) Freezes a ticdat object :param tic_dat: ticdat object :return: tic_dat, after it has been frozen good_tic_dat_object TicDatFactory.good_tic_dat_object(self, data_obj, bad_message_handler=<function TicDatFactory.<lambda> at 0x11a12dea0>) determines if an object can be can be converted to a TicDat data object. :param data_obj: the object to verify :param bad_message_handler: a call back function to receive description of any failure message :return: True if the dataObj can be converted to a TicDat data object. False otherwise. good_tic_dat_table TicDatFactory.good_tic_dat_table(self, data_table, table_name, bad_message_handler=<function TicDatFactory.<lambda> at 0x11a12e158>) determines if an object can be can be converted to a TicDat data table. :param dataObj: the object to verify :param table_name: the name of the table :param bad_message_handler: a call back function to receive description of any failure message :return: True if the dataObj can be converted to a TicDat data table. False otherwise. obfusimplify TicDatFactory.obfusimplify(self, tic_dat, table_prepends={}, skip_tables=(), freeze_it=False) copies the tic_dat object into a new, obfuscated, simplified tic_dat object :param tic_dat: a ticdat object :param table_prepends: a dictionary with mapping each table to the prepend it should apply when its entries are renamed. A valid table prepend must be all caps and not end with I. Should be restricted to entity tables (single field primary that is not a foreign key child) :param skip_tables: a listing of entity tables whose single field primary key shouldn't be renamed :param freeze_it: boolean. should the returned copy be frozen? :return: A named tuple with the following components. copy : a deep copy of the tic_dat argument, with the single field primary key values renamed to simple \"short capital letters followed by numbers\" strings. renamings : a dictionary matching the new entries to their original (table, primary key value) this entry can be used to cross reference any diagnostic information gleaned from the obfusimplified copy to the original names. For example, \"P5 has no production\" can easily be recognized as \"Product KX12212 has no production\". remove_foreign_key_failures TicDatFactory.remove_foreign_key_failures(self, tic_dat, propagate=True) Removes foreign key failures (i.e. child records with no parent table record) :param tic_dat: ticdat object :param propagate boolean: remove cascading failures? (if removing the child record results in new failures, should those be removed as well?) :return: tic_dat, with the foreign key failures removed replace_data_type_failures TicDatFactory.replace_data_type_failures(self, tic_dat, replacement_values={}) Replace the data cells with data type failures with the default value for the appropriate field. :param tic_dat: :param replacement_values: a dictionary mapping (table, field) to replacement value. the default value will be used for (table, field) pairs not in replacement_values :return: the tic_dat object with replacements made. The tic_dat object itself will be edited in place. Replaces any of the data failures found in find_data_type_failures() with the appropriate replacement_value. Note - won't perform primary key replacements. schema TicDatFactory.schema(self, include_ancillary_info=False) :param include_ancillary_info: if True, include all the foreign key, default, and data type information as well. Otherwise, just return table-fields dictionary :return: a dictionary with table name mapping to a list of lists defining primary key fields and data fields If include_ancillary_info, this table-fields dictionary is just one entry in a more comprehensive dictionary. set_ampl_data TicDatFactory.set_ampl_data(self, tic_dat, ampl, table_to_set_name=None) performs bulk setData on the AMPL first argument. :param tic_dat: an AmplTicDat object created by calling copy_to_ampl :param ampl: an amplpy.AMPL object :param table_to_set_name: a mapping of table_name to ampl set name :return: set_data_type TicDatFactory.set_data_type(self, table, field, number_allowed=True, inclusive_min=True, inclusive_max=False, min=0, max=inf, must_be_int=False, strings_allowed=(), nullable=False, datetime=False) sets the data type for a field. By default, fields don't have types. Adding a data type doesn't block data of the wrong type from being entered. Data types are useful for recognizing errant data entries with find_data_type_failures(). Errant data entries can be replaced with replace_data_type_failures(). :param table: a table in the schema :param field: a data field for this table :param number_allowed: boolean does this field allow numbers? :param inclusive_min: boolean : if number allowed, is the min inclusive? :param inclusive_max: boolean : if number allowed, is the max inclusive? :param min: if number allowed, the minimum value :param max: if number allowed, the maximum value :param must_be_int: boolean : if number allowed, must the number be integral? :param strings_allowed: if a collection - then a list of the strings allowed. The empty collection prohibits strings. If a \"*\", then any string is accepted. :param nullable : boolean : can this value contain null (aka None) :param datetime: If truthy, then number_allowed through strings_allowed are ignored. Should the data either be a datetime.datetime object or a string that can be parsed into a datetime.datetime object? Note that the various readers will try to coerce strings into datetime.datetime objects on read for fields with datetime data types. pandas.Timestamp is itself a datetime.datetime, and the bias will be to create such an object. :return: set_default_value TicDatFactory.set_default_value(self, table, field, default_value) sets the default value for a specific field :param table: a table in the schema :param field: a field in the table :param default_value: the default value to apply :return: set_default_values TicDatFactory.set_default_values(self, **tableDefaults) sets the default values for the fields :param tableDefaults: A dictionary of named arguments. Each argument name (i.e. each key) should be a table name Each value should itself be a dictionary mapping data field names to default values Ex: tdf.set_default_values(categories = {\"minNutrition\":0, \"maxNutrition\":float(\"inf\")}, foods = {\"cost\":0}, nutritionQuantities = {\"qty\":0}) :return: set_generator_tables TicDatFactory.set_generator_tables(self, g) sets which tables are to be generator tables. Generator tables are represented as generators pulled from the actual data store. This prevents them from being fulled loaded into memory.

The outer iterable is thus of length num_rows + 1, while each of the inner iterables are of length num_cols. :param formatter: a function used to turn column entries into strings :param max_write: the maximum number of table entries to write to the actual log file. :return: Progress Progress(self, quiet=False) Utility class for indicating progress. numerical_progress Progress.numerical_progress(self, theme, progress) indicate generic progress :param theme: string describing the type of progress being advanced :param progress: numerical indicator to the degree of progress advanced :return: False if GUI indicates solve should gracefully finish, True otherwise mip_progress Progress.mip_progress(self, theme, lower_bound, upper_bound) indicate progress towards solving a MIP via converging upper and lower bounds :param theme: string describing the type of MIP solve underway :param lower_bound: the best current lower bound to the MIP objective :param upper_bound: the best current upper bound to the MIP objective :return: False if GUI indicates solve should gracefully finish, True otherwise gurobi_call_back_factory Progress.gurobi_call_back_factory(self, theme, model) create a MIP call back handler for Gurobi :param theme: string describing the type of MIP solve underway :param model: a Gurobi model :return: a call_back function that can be passed to optimize","title":"Utilities"},{"location":"xls/","text":"XlsTicFactory XlsTicFactory(self, tic_dat_factory) Primary class for reading/writing Excel files with TicDat objects. Your system will need the xlrd package to read .xls and .xlsx files, the xlwt package to write .xls files, and the xlsxwriter package to write .xlsx files. Don't create this object explicitly. A XlsTicDatFactory will automatically be associated with the xls attribute of the parent TicDatFactory. create_tic_dat XlsTicFactory.create_tic_dat(self, xls_file_path, row_offsets=None, headers_present=True, treat_inf_as_infinity=True, freeze_it=False) Create a TicDat object from an Excel file :param xls_file_path: An Excel file containing sheets whose names match the table names in the schema. :param row_offsets: (optional) A mapping from table names to initial number of rows to skip :param headers_present: Boolean. Does the first row of data contain the column headers? :param treat_inf_as_infinity: Boolean. Treat the \"inf\" string (case insensitive) as as infinity. Similar for \"-inf\" :param freeze_it: boolean. should the returned object be frozen? :return: a TicDat object populated by the matching sheets. caveats: Missing sheets resolve to an empty table, but missing fields on matching sheets throw an Exception. Sheet names are considered case insensitive, and white space is replaced with underscore for table name matching. Field names are considered case insensitive, but white space is respected. (ticdat supports whitespace in field names but not table names). The following two caveats apply only if data_types are used. --> Any field for which an empty string is invalid data and None is valid data will replace the empty string with None. --> Any field for which must_be_int is true will replace numeric data that satisfies int(x)==x with int(x). In other words, the ticdat equivalent of pandas.read_excel convert_float is to set must_be_int to true in data_types. find_duplicates XlsTicFactory.find_duplicates(self, xls_file_path, row_offsets={}, headers_present=True) Find the row counts for duplicated rows. :param xls_file_path: An Excel file containing sheets whose names match the table names in the schema (non primary key tables ignored). :param row_offsets: (optional) A mapping from table names to initial number of rows to skip (non primary key tables ignored) :param headers_present: Boolean. Does the first row of data contain the column headers? caveats: Missing sheets resolve to an empty table, but missing primary fields on matching sheets throw an Exception. Sheet names are considered case insensitive. :return: A dictionary whose keys are the table names for the primary key tables. Each value of the return dictionary is itself a dictionary. The inner dictionary is keyed by the primary key values encountered in the table, and the value is the count of records in the Excel sheet with this primary key. Row counts smaller than 2 are pruned off, as they aren't duplicates write_file XlsTicFactory.write_file(self, tic_dat, file_path, allow_overwrite=False, case_space_sheet_names=False) write the ticDat data to an excel file :param tic_dat: the data object to write (typically a TicDat) :param file_path: The file path of the excel file to create Needs to end in either \".xls\" or \".xlsx\" The latter is capable of writing out larger tables, but the former handles infinity seamlessly. If \".xlsx\", then be advised that +/- float(\"inf\") will be replaced with \"inf\"/\"-inf\", unless infinity_io_flag is being applied. :param allow_overwrite: boolean - are we allowed to overwrite an existing file? case_space_sheet_names: boolean - make best guesses how to add spaces and upper case characters to sheet names :return: caveats: None may be written out as an empty string. This reflects the behavior of xlwt.","title":"XlsTicFactory"}]}
