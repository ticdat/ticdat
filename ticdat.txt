NAME
    ticdat - ticDat module for reading and writing data modules in ticDat format.

FILE
    /Users/petercacioppi/src/opalytics-ticdat/ticdat/__init__.py

DESCRIPTION
    ticDat is a simple, easy-to-read format for tabular data. It is partly inspired by csv.DictReader
    and csv.DictWriter.  When primary keys are specified, each table is a dictionary of dictionaries.
    Otherwise, each table is an enumerable of dictionaries (as in DictReader/DictWriter). When foreign keys are
    specified, they are used to create links between the "row dictionaries" of the parent table to the matching
    "row dictionaries" of the child objects.
    
    Although ticDat was specifically designed with Mixed Integer Programming data sets in mind, it can be used for
    rapidly developing a wide variety of mathematical engines. It facilitates creating one definition of your
    input data schema and one solve module, and reusing this same code, unchanged, on data from different
    sources. This "separation of model from data" enables a user to move easily from toy, hard coded data to
    larger, more realistic data sets. In addition, Opalytics Inc. (the developer of the ticDat library) can support
    cloud deployments of solve engines that use the ticDat library.
    
    The ticDat library is distributed under the BSD2 open source license.

     |  Primary class for reading/writing csv files with ticDat objects.
     |  Your system will need the csv package if you want to use this class.

     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, tic_dat_factory)
     |      Don't create this object explicitly. A CsvTicDatFactory will
     |      automatically be associated with the csv attribute of the parent
     |      TicDatFactory.
     |      :param tic_dat_factory:
     |      :return:
     |  
     |  create_tic_dat(self, dir_path, dialect='excel', headers_present=True, freeze_it=False)
     |      Create a TicDat object from the csv files in a directory
     |      :param dir_path: the directory containing the .csv files.
     |      :param dialect: the csv dialect. Consult csv documentation for details.
     |      :param headers_present: Boolean. Does the first row of data contain the
     |                              column headers?
     |      :param freeze_it: boolean. should the returned object be frozen?
     |      :return: a TicDat object populated by the matching files.
     |      caveats: Missing files resolve to an empty table, but missing fields on
     |               matching files throw an Exception.
     |               Data field values (but not primary key values) will be coerced
     |               into floats if possible.
     |  
     |  get_duplicates(self, dir_path, dialect='excel', headers_present=True)
     |      Find the row counts for duplicated rows.
     |      :param dir_path: the directory containing .csv files.
     |      :param dialect: the csv dialect. Consult csv documentation for details.
     |      :param headers_present: Boolean. Does the first row of data contain
     |                              the column headers?
     |      :return: A dictionary whose keys are the table names for the primary key tables. Each value
     |               of the return dictionary is itself a dictionary. The inner dictionary is keyed by the
     |               primary key values encountered in the table, and the value is the count of records in the
     |               Excel sheet with this primary key. Row counts smaller than 2 are pruned off, as they
     |               aren't duplicates
     |      caveats: Missing files resolve to an empty table, but missing fields (data or primary key) on
     |               matching files throw an Exception.
     |  
     |  write_directory(self, tic_dat, dir_path, allow_overwrite=False, dialect='excel', write_header=True)
     |      write the ticDat data to a collection of csv files
     |      :param tic_dat: the data object
     |      :param dir_path: the directory in which to write the csv files
     |      :param allow_overwrite: boolean - are we allowed to overwrite existing
     |                              files?
     |      :param dialect: the csv dialect. Consult csv documentation for details.
     |      :param write_header: Boolean. Should the header information be written
     |                           as the first row?

     |      Adds a foreign key relationship to the schema.  Adding a foreign key doesn't block

     |      unpacked, to the TicDat constructor.

     |  
     |  clear_data_type(self, table, field)
     |      clears the data type for a field. By default, fields don't types.  Adding a data type doesn't block

     |      call to enable foreign key links. For ex. a TicDat object made from

     |              dat.nutritionQuantities["chicken", "protein"])
     |      Note that by default, TicDatFactories don't create foreign key links since doing so

     |                                data

     |               That is to say, native_values tells you which values in the native table
     |               can't find a foreign key match, and thus generate a foreign key failure.
